<div class="error-page">
  <h4>You Aren’t Supposed to Be Here.</h4>

  <p>You’ve taken a wrong turn.</p>

  <p>
    The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist… or it used to… before <strong><em>The Incident.</em></strong><br>
    Records were wiped. Accesses revoked.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet… here you are. Standing in digital shadows.<br>
    A forbidden byte in the wrong place at the wrong time... <em>*clocks gun*</em>
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    But, <em>uh—</em>before this gets weird, maybe you're just lost?<br>
    No worries... <em>*holsters gun*</em> Happens all the time.
  </p>

  <h5>While we don't have what you were looking for, we <b>do</b> have:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><em>A joke about quantum computers that only makes sense if you're not looking at it.</em></li>
    <li><em>A cat who got stuck in the site map (he’s fine now).</em></li>
    <li><em>And a warm, friendly button to take you home.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote><em>"It’s dangerous to go alone!"</em> — but mostly because this page is unfinished.</blockquote>
