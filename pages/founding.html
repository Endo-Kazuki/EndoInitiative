<h3>Hey, thanks for stopping by,</h3>
<p>this is Endo writing to you. I wanted to share a short story of the events leading up to founding this organization and the general reasoning of why I'm here.</p>
<p>Life for me was the furthest thing you can think of from easy, without exaggeration it sucked, for 20 years as a 21 year old (as of writing this in 2025) I dealt with what I could only personally describe as unimaginable pains, traumas, and suffering. Yeah, the whole sha-bang.</p>

<p>Throughout all of that time, I didn't believe things would ever get better, but to my own surprise, it actually did at the end of 2024.</p>

<p>In December of 2024 I was in a really bad place and I wont get into the specific kinds of problems; but it suffices me to say that it couldn't be numbered. I had run away a few years prior to escape some problems and was surviving on my own for a time, while it worked in part, it led to more problems. </p>

<p>However, in the long time I was away, there was a major shift in the dynamics I had with my family. We had grown much closer and they were willing to throw me a lifeline to take me back home. That event I could honestly say marked the end to my problems in which my story boils down to this...</p>

<p>I reached a point where I could actually breathe, and during that time, one simple question came to mind.</p>

<h4>"Who do I want to be?"</h4>

<p>I mean really? My entire life I was forced into someone who wasn't me, someone stuck in a state of survival.</p>

<p>Of course the answer didn't come to me immediately, I spent months of sorting through my own thoughts and my life experiences in which eventually, I had come to the conclusion of: 
"I want to be the person that I never had for myself growing up, the person that I so desperately needed, and then to be that person for others."</p>

<p></p>A scenario that plays in my head a lot is that I wish that I could've been there for my younger self, because I know his life would've turned out so differently.

<p>And while I can't do that for myself, I can do it for others, so I am (or at least trying my best to).</p>

<p>Here we are today, the Endo Initiative was given birth.</p>
  
<p>I'm not here to line my own pockets sneakily and call it service, I'm here with the purpose that the world is broken, but it doesn't have to be. Really, it's true! The models and systems we live with are still here because we allow them to be. You can notice the same patterns everywhere: </p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technology designed to extract and track and profit off of the person behind it.</li>
    <li>Insurance that tries its hardest to not help you after paying them for that service.</li>
    <li>Healthcare that places a steep price on your health and aid.</li>
    <li>Education that puts you in debt for trying to learn.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>I could continue to list far more, but I think you get the point. We shouldn't have to navigate life with the sole purpose that the companies of the world don't see you as more than just an endpoint for profit.</p>
<p>At it's core, this initiative is guided by the belief that <strong>your burdens are my burdens, and my strength is your strength.</strong> Meaning, I see the flaws in the systems, I see the struggles that people have to work through, and you can rely on the promise that my strength and efforts will be used for you, and for the sake of every person out there.</p>

<p>Change won't be wrought about in a single night, but I'd gladly spend every night for the rest of my life ensuring that it's on its way.</p>

<p><strong>Signing off with Love</strong></p>
